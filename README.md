A simple abstraction layer around NetSSH.

Features:
* `Host` allows you to easily SSH/SCP to a host using local SSH defaults
* `Actions` allows you to automate your interactions on a `Host`
* Put it all together in order to automate your SSH-based workflows, such as
  installing Puppet.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'chloride'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install chloride

## Usage

Check out the example [`go_execute` command](bin/go_execute)

    $ bundle exec bin/go_execute 'abc123.example.com' 'cat /etc/hosts'

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Release

We use [gem-release](https://github.com/svenfuchs/gem-release) to make the gem release process easier.
```
# with any of these commands, provide --pretend to see what would happen
# First we bump the lib/chloride/version.rb file
bundle exec gem bump -v 1.1.1       # Bump to the given, specific version number
bundle exec gem bump -v major       # Bump to the next major level (e.g. 0.0.1 to 1.0.0)
bundle exec gem bump -v minor       # Bump to the next minor level (e.g. 0.0.1 to 0.1.0)
bundle exec gem bump -v patch       # Bump to the next patch level (e.g. 0.0.1 to 0.0.2)
# Finally, we tag and release
bundle exec gem release -t -p       # Tag (-t), and push (-p) the gem
```
